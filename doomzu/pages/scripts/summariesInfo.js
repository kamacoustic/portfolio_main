    chapterSummary: `After surviving a harrowing experience due to a 
    legion of seemingly undead monsters and a mysteriously hooded man, 
    our newly formed, diverse group befriended a halfling rogue named 
    Fedeilus. On his way to contact GrandMage Bickenbore, the group 
    seemingly appeared before him right before a large, 
    purple explosion rocked the countryside. 

    Fedeilus and Amir seemed to recognize the affected area as the 
    old fort town known as Bethelaham; Home to GrandMage Bickenbore,
    (one of the court magicians of King Ursus), the current ruling monarch
    of Corona Kingdom. Before Bickenbore teleported the group away from 
    danger, he pleaded that you find the Ally with a stone and press on to 
    find the other two magical stones in order to assist the King and the 
    kingdom in fending off the hooded man and his dragon.

    Fedeilus shared with the group a magical map that revealed the 
    nearby town of Amahart as a possible home to another magic stone. 
    The group decided to stick together and press on but rest and discuss
    which way to the town they would take.`

    chapterSummary: `The group decided to take the path through the 
    Hart Mountains. They survived a fierce Griffon group mating ritual, 
    encountered and helped a stone giant and his ettin companion, and 
    got to walk away generally unharmed with a new magical bag of holding.

    The group arrived in Amahart and checked into the Hart Inn with Martha,
    the Dwarven Inn-keeper. As the group rested, there were a few items 
    that hung in the air such as the whereabouts of Klaas, the Tiefling 
    Wizard as he mounted his broom of flying and seemed to have flown away 
    whilst on the mountain trek; Why is the stone given to the group by 
    Bickenbore pulsating through the night? And last but not least, 
    where is the next stone that is needed within Amahart? `

    chapterSummary:`Completing their rest from their recent trek through 
    the Hart Mountains, our group awakened to a stunned, shocked, and 
    frantic Amahart. Amir, Vorin, and Fedeilus were the first to emerge 
    from their rooms. In an attempt to awaken the others, Tontai and 
    Rondel did not respond to their knocks and calls and were left to 
    their own devices. Deciding it's best to leave them to their privacy 
    and possible "deep" meditation, the three decided to seek out the town
    or information regarding the inner workings of the town but more 
    importantly, finding information about the next magic stone which 
    according to Bickenbore's map, revealed Amahart to be a point of 
    interest.
    
    The three question the current inn-keep at the time, Marie,
    who is revealed to be Martha's, (the inn-keep the party met the night 
    before) ,daughter. Marie shared some basic information and got the 
    group pointed in a few different directions to begin their search. 
    Mainly, the Flare Industries foundry and the Mayor's office, both of
    which were under heavy guard from a recent upsurge of Corona Kingdom 
    military occupation; A direct result of the extreme event that wiped 
    Bethelaham off the surface of Zu.

    On the way to the foundry, our group encountered some of the town folk who were panicked and
    frantic after learning of Bethelaham's fate. The group disguised 
    themselves as an semi-religious entertainment troupe and engrossed 
    some of the town folk; specifically a dwarven woman with a baby. 
    In an attempt to showcase their "allegiance" to their sun god, 
    our troupe threw the baby to be "one with the sun" and won over the 
    trust of this dwarven woman. 

    Taking the troupe and what was left of her child home, the group met Rok, the Dwarven woman's human partner 
    and current employee of the Flare Industries Foundry. Deceiving the 
    two in wanting to "bless their home" for protection, Amir and Vorin 
    shared their "deep warmth" with Rok and his Dwarven wife and then 
    decided to investigate the foundry which Rok revealed was unexpectedly
    closed that day.
    
    Once there, Fedelius recognized and met up with other
    theives that were members of his own theives guild, the Strakin. 
    It was revealed that someone prominent from his past, Navrene, 
    the moon elf and high ranking Strakin thief, was outside of the Mayor's
    office and that they were awaiting her signal before attempting to 
    sneak into the foundry.
    
    The group made their way and met up with 
    Navrene. She explained that she was attempting to find Mayor Claycore,
    another one of the court wizards of Corona Kingdom who might be 
    protecting another magic stone. She assisted in helping the group 
    sneak in and infiltrate the Mayor's office which they found to be 
    empty, yet still guarded. Taking the opportunity to investigate and 
    interrogate some of the guards, it was revealed that Mayor Claycore 
    was hiding at the Flare Industries Foundry, most likely because of 
    the tram system that connects Amahart with another prominent city 
    within the Corona Kingdom, La Luna.
    
    The group decided it was best to regroup at Rok's house. 
    As they were about to get going though, suddenly numerous shadows 
    began to weave their way through Amahart, seemingly taking those 
    unfortunate enough to be in their way. Our group made their way to 
    Rok's, set up their defenses utilizing light and flame, and holed in 
    for the night. During the night, our group witnessed two shadowy 
    silhouettes emerge under the cover of darkness. In an attempt to 
    eavesdrop, the group’s temporary haven was compromised and it was 
    revealed that the silhouettes were also in search of the stone and 
    that they were most likely aligned with Doomzu,the dragon that 
    vaporized Bethelaham. Unable to approach the group further seemingly 
    because of their protective light, the silhouettes slithered back 
    into the darkness of the night as quickly as they seemingly emerged.
    Now realizing that another, possibly dangerous faction was also in 
    search of Claycore and the stone, our group decided to regroup in the 
    morning at the Hart Inn, where they hoped that their other group 
    members would reconvene and head off towards the Flare Industries 
    Foundry.`

    chapterSummary:`After narrowly escaping the darkest of nights for the 
    little town of Amahart; Amir, Vorin, and Fedelius returned to the Hart
    Inn in hopes of recruiting the rest of their group to aide them. 
    Almost as if fate conspired it to be, Tontai, Rondel, and even Klaus, 
    were now present and accounted for, wondering why the other three 
    looked so concerned and panicked about time. As Amir was filling 
    everyone in on what they had experienced the night prior, the group 
    began to feel on and off tremors that shook the little mountain town. 
    Taking this as another bad sign, the group quickly set off towards the
    Flare Industries Foundry in hopes of finding Mayor Claycore and the 
    next magic stone before the mysterious silhouettes from the night 
    prior did first.
    
    As they made their way through town and even through 
    the foundry, the group realized that everyone in the town seemed to 
    have vanished without a trace. Seeing that their magic stone was 
    pulsating more and more as they entered the foundry, the group 
    realized that there was only one direction to go and that was down.
    Down to the lower level of the foundry where the recent tremors seem 
    to be the strongest.
    
    Upon their arrival, the group came upon an 
    intense battle taking place between a dwarven mage and the two 
    silhouettes from the previous night. But before they could assist 
    Mayor Claycore, the silhouettes sent two Invisible Stalkers to attack 
    the group. Working together in a blaze of magic, a flurry of magical 
    fists, a flaming divine strike mixed with swinging hammers and 
    short-swords, the group vanquished the stalkers and moved forward to 
    assist Claycore who was no longer able to hold his own against the 
    silhouettes. The group quickly learned that the silhouettes were 
    opponents unlike any they had faced before but with their quick 
    thinking, and Claycore's help, they managed to escape on the tram 
    leading away from the foundry. Now the group, taking advantage of 
    their harrowing escape and with the second stone entrusted to them 
    by Claycore's hand, decide to rest up and hopefully arrive in La Luna
    in peace.`,

    chapterSummary:`After taking advantage of resting upon their escape 
    tram, our team arrived to La Luna with Mayor Claycore. Whilst arriving,
    Claycore revealed that he planned on meeting with another court mage 
    by the name of Diz Deependwell. His hopes were to report his findings 
    and hopefully gain more information regarding the mysterious Invaders 
    to the Corona Kingdom. Experiencing a court mage's reputation first 
    hand, the team learned a bit more about the advanced city and settled
    in Serentitas, a wealthy neighborhood within central La Luna. 

    Claycore discovered that Deependwell was currently away and not due to
    return for another 2-3 days. He decided it was best for the team and 
    him to part ways for now in the case that the silhouettes track and 
    find them within the city. With time to explore, the team decided to 
    check out the markets of upper Tycho where thanks to Fedeilus, it's 
    discovered that there was an underground market ran by his theives 
    guild, the Strakin. After finding the hidden entrance and gaining 
    access to the Strakin market, the team discovered an incredible place 
    filled with rare and mysterious contraband ranging from laser sabers 
    to magic amplifiers, and more rare items. What will our team decide 
    to seek and find? Who are the Bhed?`

    chapterNum: 5,
    chapterSummary: `Finishing up their shopping spree in the underground 
    Strakin market, our team was sought out by none other than the 
    mysterious Navrene, the moon elf Strakin thief who had been guiding 
    Fedeilus along in the quest to assist King Ursus and obtain the three 
    magic stones. She required assistance breaking into the Flare 
    Industries laboratory on the west side of Tycho and promised rewards 
    for the help. The team agreed to help Navrene in order to find out 
    more about Flare Industries and their possible connection to the hate 
    group known as the Bhed. 
    
    Under the guise of night, the team 
    successfully infiltrated the seemingly monitored lab building to find 
    some interesting information. Files from Theo Whiteleaf's computer 
    revealed connections to a Bhed rally that is due to take place the 
    next day, the nature of the main pillar of the lab and the 
    experiments that seem to be taking place regarding Androids and 
    attempts at creating artificial souls. Before our team could make 
    their escape however, they found themselves being confronted by none 
    other than Theo Whiteleaf himself. With what appeared to be a large 
    gun in hand and the support of six flying maintenance bots, 
    Theo has now surrounded the team. A battle is due to ensue but will 
    our team make it out in one piece? `

    chapterNum: 6,
    chapterSummary: `Theo Whiteleaf and our team clashed with a fierce 
    battle. Thanks to his cybernetic enhancements, 
    Theo and the security bots seemed to be formidable opponents to Amir,
    Klaas, Tontai, and Vorin whilst Fedeilus and Rondel were captured 
    and rendered unconscious. 
    
    A typhoon of intense meta-sorcery, 
    powerful magic, missile catching martial arts, and overwhelming 
    brute strength aptly challenged Theo and his bots. Upon his demise, 
    Theo's bots did not completely stagger and retaliated against the 
    team, taking the life of our favorite devout Zealot, Amir. 

    Before they knew it, the team found themselves being surrounded by 
    La Luna guardsmen. In a stroke of good luck, Navrene appeared and 
    helped the team escape. Resting at their hotel, Serendipity, 
    the team mourned over the death of Amir and planned to prepare for 
    the next day, the day of the supposed Bhed rally in Cris. . .`

    chapterNum: 7,
    chapterSummary: `As most of the group awakened from their brief respite
    following the infiltration of the La Luna Flare Industries 
    laboratory, a decision was made to go and bury Amir's body in a nearby
    cemetery. Thanks to Claycore, the group found adequate transportation 
    already prepared for them. But whilst in transit, a mysterious hooded 
    figure ambushed the procession and attempted to steal Amir's corpse. 

    After a merry chase, and before parties clashed, Navrene intervened to
    explain that this mysteriously hooded "ravenhead" is actually a 
    long-time member of the Strakin and shared some type of connection to
    Amir. Known simply as "The Hand," this Kenku thief had been spending 
    the last few days within La Luna, attempting to find cryo-tech, in an
    effort to possibly preserve Amir's body. Navrene reminded the group 
    about the coming Bhed rally and asked them to follow The Hand to 
    investigate the rally whilst she transported Amir's body to the 
    Strakin. 
    
    During the rally, tension turned to violence and an all out
    brawl occured between the hate group and it's present dissenters. 
    Thanks to Tontai's stealth skills, it was revealed that the rally was 
    a distraction so the Bhed could mount an assault against the Strakin 
    and attack the underground Strakin market. Before she could relay this 
    to the others however, some members of the Bhed suddenly detonated 
    causing further chaos. 
    
    Now in a full frenzy, our group finds 
    themselves being approached by some not so natural moving members of
    the Bhed. A taste of chaos, a dip into shadow, will our heroes 
    sink further into the black of the abyss?`
}, {
    chapterNum: 8,
    chapterSummary: `As chaos began to rise with the Bhed members 
    self-destruction at the rally, Tontai, The Hand, Vorin, and Fedeilus 
    found themselves being approached by seemingly robotic humanoids. 
    Suddenly, the earth shook violently as a giant shadow outstretched 
    across the entire city and the form of a gigantic, black dragon 
    appeared launching an assault against La Luna. Black tendrils extended from 
    the dragon's body, dropping what appeared to be loose bodies of flesh
    but upon landing, the flesh morphed into rotting corpses of orcs and 
    wood elves , some orcs larger than others. 
    
    The flash zombie mob began 
    to attack civilians still attempting to flee the violence of the rally
    but before long, the civilians seemed to fall into a trance and escape
    and suddenly, Rondel, Klaas, and Claycore appeared to lend their 
    assistance in quelling the scene. In order to contain the zombies 
    and androids, Claycore lowered the park hundreds of feet into the 
    ground and asked for assistance in terms of exterminating the 
    aggressors within the park.
    
    A fierce battle ensued with our team 
    testing their new skills on the zombie horde. In the midst of the 
    struggle, two new characters joined in the fray. One was a fierce 
    warrior donning battle scars and a giant great-axe which was wielded 
    undoubtedly with great skill. The other was a mage with no other 
    arcane focus other than the gloves he was donning. The newcomers
    helped reduce the zombies numbers before joining Claycore's bout. 
    As the dust settled, Claycore raised the park back to ground level 
    and claimed that Diz Deependwell was communicating with him directly 
    and had instructed that he take everyone to the Flare Industries 
    Laboratory where they would join up. The party, along with Claycore 
    and the two newcomers piled into hover cars that were unaffected by 
    the disaster at hand and took off towards the lab. `

    chapterNum: 9,
    chapterSummary: `Zooming away from the chaos that seemed to spark in 
    the park, our team headed for the Flare laboratory or what was left o
    f it. Right before arriving, the hover-car was suddenly attacked and 
    pursued by zombie griffons. Fending off the winged beasts, the team 
    finally were able to get inside the ruined Flare lab which housed a 
    broken barrier energy rod.
    
    Before them was a frantic yet focused 
    elven mage; Diz Deependwell required the team's help to fix the 
    damaged barrier rod and with impressive teamwork, La Luna's barrier 
    was reactivated. Suddenly a familiar hooded man appeared before the 
    team and hinted that the Intruders were going to change up their 
    attack strategy in severing La Luna off of the cliff it was 
    constructed on. 
    
    Defenses weakening by the second, Diz and Coda came 
    up with a plan to use and share Claycore's rock magic abilities to 
    "guide" the city down the cliff and save as much of the city as 
    possible. In order to do so, the mages needed full, uninterrupted, 
    focus. The others assigned themselves to defend the mages from the 
    incoming zombie horde and an intense battle ensued. With the help of 
    their friends, the team managed to successfully keep the horde 
    occupied enough to allow the mages to save what they could of the 
    collapsing city as Doomzu severed the city off the cliff. 
    With the immediate threat handled, Diz motioned the team to travel with him 
    across the desert to the capital city of the Corona Kingdom, El Sol. 
    He also revealed that their travel time and the travel time of the 
    next magic stone should line up. Loading back into the hover-car, 
    our team took off into the desert, leaving behind what was left of 
    La Luna.`

    chapterSummary: `After escaping the terrible fate that befell La Luna, 
    the team found themselves stranded in the middle of the Corona Desert;
    A barely alive Claycore slowly inching closer and closer to death. 
    Without the appropriate medical supplies or transport, 
    Diz Deependwell asked for the teams help in investigating a 
    mysterious presence that he sensed through combined meditation 
    with Tontai. Prepared and nourished, our team made their way through 
    the harsh heat and crumbling dunes, following the "cat" paw prints 
    they discovered whilst on their trek. After fending off an aggressive
    air elemental, the team found themselves looking into what appeared 
    to be a wide and deep depression in the sand. As they approached the 
    center, a gynosphinx appeared before them and informed the team that 
    if they solved it's riddle, they would be granted access to the ruins
    under it's guard where "what they seeked" would lie within. 
    he team solved the riddle and with the Sphinx's blessing and warning, 
    our team decided to make camp and rest before entering the black 
    pyramid that appeared before them. . . .

    What dangers could possibly await our heroes inside??
    Will the Sphinx's claim be true that they will "find what they seek" within and will it be found fast enough to save Claycore?
    Who really is the person the sphinx referenced in regards to also solving it's riddle and plundering the ruins before the party??`
}, {
    chapterNum: 11,
    chapterSummary: `Wrapping up their rest outside of the gynosphinx's 
    ruins, our party made their final preparations before entering. 
    Rondel decided to stand guard outside for precaution and Klaas 
    decided to take more time examining the outside of the ruins. 
    Tontai, Fedeilus, Vorin, and,The Hand then made their way to the 
    entrance of the large obsidian black pyramid. As they approached, 
    a mysterious message inscribed itself atop the entryway. 
    Although familiar in nature to some, it was discerned that part of the
    message contained the number "4."

    Entering the ruin, our ruin explorers found themselves within a giant,
    cavernous room that contained a set of massive double doors sealed 
    with what appeared to be a sheet of paper, four massive pillars with 
    different colored crystals atop each pillar, and three other doors 
    seemingly leading to different parts of the ruins. 
    
    Quickly deducing that each room lent themselves to being investigated before moving 
    forward, our explorers found themselves in puzzling scenarios 
    including recreating the seasons, defying gravity and retracing 
    their steps, and learning to hone in on some of their physical senses 
    in order to overcome darkness. Each trial provided a key necessary in 
    order to eventually activate the crystals within the main chamber 
    room and remove the paper seal from the double doors.
    
    Once again unlocked, the party sensed a powerful, evil presence 
    seemingly emanating from behind the double doors. Before proceeding 
    through, the explorers decided to retreat back outside of the pyramid
    to rest and regroup with their other party members before facing the 
    evil that lays within.`

    chapterNum: 12,
    chapterSummary: `Regrouping once again outside the gynosphinx's ruins,
    Klaas decided to remain outside in order to keep studying the pyramid.
    He also wanted to communicate with Diz since some time had passed since
    their arrival. Fedeilus, still afflicted by the mummy rot curse, 
    decided to stay behind as well which left Tontai, Rondel, The Hand, 
    and Vorin to the evil presence now awakened inside.

    As the group entered the pyramid and proceeded through the now 
    unsealed double doors, they found themselves with a room with golden 
    floors, a decorated sarcophagus inscribed with symbols and characters, 
    a crystal fixed to the ground, and a slab blocking the main chambers 
    light from striking the crystal. By breaking the slab, the crystal was
    then alight and the sarcophagus opened to reveal a mummy lord, 
    clad in red, ornate bandages and wraps.

    A fierce and dangerous battle ensued but thanks to the persistence and 
    power of the team, the mummy lord was vanquished and freed. 
    It revealed another room where inside, the team encountered the 
    gynosphinx once again.

    She led Rondel to cut her and provided four drops of her blood. 
    A healing agent powerful enough to heal any ailment. 
    The gynosphinx also hinted that the team were free to investigate 
    the rest of the room and seemingly vanished.

    The rest of the room contained what appeared to be ancient advanced
    technology, a battered and decaying corpse sitting upright in a chair,
    and behind the corpse, a giant golden ring construct. 
    The light of the ruins crystals, landing upon the corpse's chest.

    Deciding it would be a good idea to perhaps have the investigation 
    skills of the others, the team made their way out of the ruins, 
    only to be met by the unexpected presence of what appeared to be 
    heavily armed, red bandana clad militia. This militia, 
    already holding Klaas and Fedeilus hostage, suddenly converged on 
    the rest of the team pointing their loaded weapons.`
}, {
    chapterNum: 13,
    chapterSummary: `Being unexpectedly held up gunpoint, our party 
    members found themselves in a seemingly precarious situation. 
    Fifteen red bandana clad roughians surrounded and kept steady aim upon
    everyone. Sensing that this mysterious group seemed more nervous than
    malicious, the party made their defense in stating that they were 
    enemies of Flare; the seemingly evil corporation responsible for 
    bringing a new age of technological advancement to Corona Kingdom 
    whilst also funding hate groups such as the Bhed.
    
    Thanks to the black thumbdrive procured during the heist of the Flare 
    laboratory in La Luna, the mysterious red bandana group decided to 
    assist the party in whatever way they could. Rondel and Klaas guided
    a small team of roughians back to Claycore, Diz, Coda, and Cora whilst
    the rest of the roughians decided to stand guard over the entrance of 
    the ruins in order to allow the other party members to investigate 
    the newly revealed room.

    Upon re-entering the ruins and leading themselves back into the room
    revealed, the party noticed that the mummy lord was still present yet,
    non-aggressive. Now back in the room, the party took in their 
    surroundings: dusty, seemingly ancient, yet highly advanced machinery 
    filled the room. An old, decrepit corpse was strapped in and seated 
    upon a seat with the light of the ruins striking it’s chest. 
    Behind it, a ramp leading up to a giant, golden ring.

    It didn’t take Fedeilus long to find a power switch. Flipping it on, 
    the machinery whirred and sprung to life. A terminal and autonomous 
    engravings activated before the party. After some quick thinking, 
    the party soon gained access to this ancient terminal and combed 
    through its contents. Memory logs and what appeared to be controls 
    for some process.

    Combing through the memory logs, the party visually saw and 
    simultaneously “experienced” the memories contained within which 
    revealed some information relating to the ancient empire responsible 
    for the construction of the temple, the Kiken. The Kiken were once an
    empire comprised of almost all of the races natural to the world. 
    Technology and magic flourished and the empire expanded and was 
    prosperous. The scientist and mages assigned to build and work within 
    the temple felt joy to be apart of this rich culture. Over time, 
    humans and elves began to fight over who was the superior race and 
    the Kiken empire slowly began to divide itself from the inside, 
    even leading to a sect of the empire leaving.

    The once curious and miraculous temple became a dark testing ground
    for new experiments that included pain and possible torture. 
    Soon after, the Kiken empire grew in strength yet again as 
    inter-dimensional travel was discovered and utilized to make new 
    discoveries and advancements in technology and magic. 
    The final memory showcased nothing but flames and the silhouette of a
    giant, black dragon.
    
    Seeing the other options available on the terminal listed as “Prime” 
    and “Activate”, the team decided to take their chances and discover 
    the function of these two options. Choosing “Prime” first, the party 
    suddenly saw power course through the seated corpse whilst the golden 
    ring began to vibrate and hum. But other than that, nothing appeared 
    to truly activate.

    Deciding to try and resurrect the seated corpse, 
    Tontai carefully climbed onto the ceiling above and carefully 
    administered some of the remaining sphinx’s blood to the electrified 
    body. Suddenly, the mummy lord emerged through the wall and seated 
    itself within the seated corpse, reviving the body. But yet, 
    nothing had occurred with the golden ring.

    Finally, Fedeilus chose the “Activate” option on the terminal and the
    temple’s light suddenly changed in nature from a single ray to a 
    seemingly flowing channel of light. The now revived mummy lord became
    overwhelmed with energy and the light began to shine through their
    body and into the center of the golden ring.

    A smokey ring began to spiral out from where the temple’s light had 
    struck the center and as if it were a window into another place 
    entirely, the party found themselves looking at a heavily forested 
    and foggy hollow where there stood a tall and slender woman wearing 
    wavy, blue clothing. She reached out to the party as if inviting 
    them to join her in her foggy hollow

    Tontai and Fedeilus crossed the gate into the hollow and recognized
    the woman as the woman depicted within the temple’s stained glass 
    room. She spoke with a soft and soothing voice familiar to them, the 
    voice of the gynosphinx.

    The woman revealed that the light and crystals within the temple were
    actually something called Primordial Light and that this light was 
    the key to defeating the black dragon and the hooded man. She also 
    revealed that the stones being sought after by the party were indeed,
    crystalized primordial light which could possibly forward the passage
    of time and that the temple they found themselves within, was one of 
    four temples scattered across the world.

    Before leaving the temple, the mummy lord reemerged from the corpse 
    and guided the party towards opening it’s coffin where treasure and 
    a strange necklace was found. Once touched, the mummy lord seemingly
    evaporated into the necklace. The Hand demanded to hold the necklace 
    whilst Vorin refused to hand it over. A short scuffle occurred before 
    The Hand decided to move on and lead the way out of the Genesis temple.

    Once outside, the red bandana roughians reported that Rondel, Klas, 
    and their company successfully found the others and that they were all
    due to meet back “home”, or wherever it was that this mysterious gang
    called home. Boarding the hover-ships piloted by the roughians, 
    the party found themselves traveling to what seemed to be another 
    dimension except that this setting didn’t seem to be complete. 
    All that was present was a huge, advanced city with a nearby beach.

    Landing within a hanger, our team convened and after some persuasion,
    soon found themselves meeting an individual some of the more 
    mysterious members of this gang called “Dad”. This “Dad” character 
    was a young man named Brek and he offered to help crack the black 
    thumbdrive and the other thumb drives given to you by the soul of the
    gynosphinx. 

    Before getting to work however, the party decided to rest in order to
    be at their best before trying to access the surely valuable 
    information stored on these thumb drives. Who is Brek and this “Umbra”
    gang really? And why do they have such disdain for Flare? How does 
    Brek know Cora and Coda? What will happen to Claycore? Can this 
    “Umbra” group really heal his soul exhaustion without utilizing the
    sphinx’s blood? Who and or what are the mysterious “trenchcoat 
    humanoids” and why do they have such childlike demeanors? 
    What is this mysterious “pocket dimension” and who constructed it?`

    chapterSummary: `Finally finding an opportunity to truly rest and 
    recuperate within the mysterious "Haven" dimension/city, our party 
    members spent time together. Primarily grabbing a meal together and
    visiting the armory. Hearing that Claycore had finally awoken from 
    his unconscious state, the party went to go see their ally. 
    Hearing the news that he had failed to not only save La Luna but also 
    had fellow dwarfs die on his watch, Claycore expressed disappointment 
    and frustration and asked to have privacy. Diz then shared that in 
    their previous encounter with the hooded man, he was able to extract 
    some information from the man's mind and that it was imperative that 
    the news be related to the King and the kingdom.
    
    The information being that the hooded man was planning to launch a 
    full frontal assault on El Sol, the capital of the Corona Kingdom. 
    With the might of the dragon and it's undead army,  
    The hooded man was looking to somehow call down the sun by finding
    Amir and the king of the Corona Kingdom, King Ursus. 
    Diz also shared that there is presently a "traitor" amongst some of 
    the kingdom's ranks and that Flare were to "lower their defenses" 
    during this attack. All of this to take place within a month's time. 
    With imperative directives now, our party members found themselves 
    urgently needing to travel to El Sol.

    Brek, the leader of "Umbra," decided to assist and provide the party 
    with a few items including: a fully staffed hovership complete with 
    cabins to rest, a VR module equipped for the party to utilize their 
    Gynosphinx flash drives, and complete disguises in order to 
    successfully enter El Sol undetected. The ship also had the ability 
    to be instantly contained and portable by shrinking into a reusable 
    capsule. With a reassuring and promising goodbye, (granted the ability 
    to come back to "haven" almost any time the ship was operable), Brek 
    sent the party off on the newly appointed, "The Will of God." Having a 
    few hours to kill on the commute to El Sol, the party members decided 
    to utilize their Gynosphinx flash drives and get into disguise as the 
    bright and wondrous city of El Sol rose into the horizon.

    chapterSummary: `Safely arriving in El Sol and starting to get used to
    their disguises, our party managed to slip in through the heavily 
    guarded checkpoints only to be met by a bombardment of futuristic 
    pop-up ads. Through the electric haze lay a highly technologically 
    advanced city-scape complete with public teleportation pads and no 
    sign of natural greenery anywhere. Suddenly a different ad appeared 
    to both Fedeilus and The Hand which was full of raven insignia's and 
    imagery. A Strakin guild member was speaking to both through this 
    hacked advertisement.
    
    The guild member passed along a few pieces of information that 
    included that the third magic stone, set to be arriving around the 
    same time as the party, had not arrived yet. Concerned, Diz 
    immediately went off to go find the stone. The second piece of 
    information passed was that Naverene, whose whereabouts were unknown,
    was working hard to find any information about Amir’s body. 
    She got a tip from a supposed informant, a mole working with the 
    Strakin currently and wanted the party to investigate. 
    The mole worked for a crime boss named Tor Mal and said that Mr. Mal
    had some information about Flare and the possible whereabouts of Amir. 
    Tor Mal supposedly hung around the Red Sand club located within the 
    Mercurius district of the city.

    Bidding a final farewell with a personal message from Naverene, 
    the party made their way to the Red Sand Club, getting directions 
    from U.R.S., the city’s A.I. surveillance system. Although their 
    first few times inner-city teleporting was a bit hairy, the party 
    managed to find their way to the club and entered a scene that 
    included flowing alcohol, thumping techno music, and subtle hints of 
    the presence of the Bhed. Following the focus of The Hand to find 
    Amir quicker, the party made their way to the back of the club where
    they found a scruffy, tall, and slender man standing guard. 
    Thanks to Fedeilus, the party was able to identify him as the 
    Strakin mole and the man led them upstairs to meet with Tor Mal.

    They entered a room filled with Bhed members and sitting in the center
    was a menacing figure with sunglasses on and a knot top haircut. 
    The orc known as Tor Mal commanded his allies to leave the party, 
    the scruffy man, and him alone. Once gone, the negotiation began 
    right away, with Tor revealing to the party that each district of 
    El Sol contained a Flare laboratory except for one, the Pluto 
    district which had been restricted by Flare and the kingdom years 
    ago. Stories of a mysterious sickness that affected the residents 
    of the Pluto district spread overtime, adding to the mystery and 
    danger of attempting to infiltrate. But Tor explained that the past 
    few days, there was more activity occurring on the outskirts and that 
    the district had reportedly been “cleaner” than before, leading some 
    to believe that there was indeed a secret laboratory located within 
    the Pluto district.

    Tor offered to have his “guard” accompany the party as he knew the way
    in exchange for valuables. Bartering the stolen La Luna relics, 
    the party and their new companion were seemingly ready to leave the 
    club but upon attempting to leave, the party suddenly found 
    themselves surrounded by Tor’s Bhed allies. He declared that he knew 
    that they were criminals themselves and that their bounties were 
    worth too much to let pass him by.

    With no other choice but to defend themselves, the party suddenly 
    found themselves within a club beatdown complete with physical 
    violence, magic/soda restraints, and ending violently with Tor 
    getting his head blown off by The Hand’s new shoulder cannon. 
    The club patrons, now in a complete panic, began to flee the club 
    and spill onto the streets. The scruffy man exclaimed that the El 
    Sol guardsmen were sure to appear soon and that it would be best to 
    leave posthaste.

    The party left and led by the scruffy man, they found themselves 
    within what appeared to be an old Strakin safehouse. The man 
    introduced himself as Zeke and told them that they needed to 
    infiltrate the Pluto district by night in order to increase their 
    chances of getting in undetected. The problem was that marshall law 
    was live within El Sol due to the recent events that had shook the 
    Corona Kingdom and that a strict curfew was in effect. Also, 
    although proficient in infiltration due to his background and prior 
    experience being a member of the famed, Bethelaham Five, Zeke could 
    only hold off the U.R.S. surveillance system for 30 minutes total.

    Agreeing to these conditions, the party and Zeke waited until 
    nightfall and set off into the dark. Upon their arrival, Zeke shared 
    that if anyone were to try and interfere with their mission or once 
    the 30 minutes were up, he would fire his gun to where the party 
    would be alerted to try and get back to him to escape. Releasing his 
    hacker orbs, the party left Zeke and started to make their way 
    through the Pluto district. Once inside, they noticed that the 
    streets were barren, littered with yellow barrels and hazmat suits 
    everywhere. Following a map provided to the party, they found 
    themselves finding a seemingly uninteresting building with a hidden 
    elevator inside.

    Riding down the glass elevator, our party suddenly found themselves 
    descending into a cavernous room with glass pods scattered throughout 
    and a golden ring construct looming in the background. The Hand and 
    Vorin both felt a similar and familiar sensation that guided them 
    towards a specific pod which proved to be both locked and durable 
    to their attempts at opening it. Suddenly, bright lights turned on 
    and illuminated gianatic, glass tanks filled with floating bodies 
    and body parts. A familiar laugh rang through the air as the party 
    found themselves being greeted somehow by Theo Whiteleaf.

    Theo claimed that Flare had extracted more of their fair share of data 
    from Amir and his “incredible vitality.” That their cloning technique 
    had been perfected and that meant that their experiments with 
    “Pneuma Gates” was bound to go above and beyond in its current 
    progress. Hinting that Amir was experimented on as well, Theo opened 
    the pod before the party and out hopped out a terrifying, 
    cybernetically altered Amir.

    A great battle ensued ending in Theo’s death yet again and Amir 
    becoming incapacitated. Not being able to snap Amir into his senses, 
    The Hand made a hard decision and suddenly sacrificed his own life 
    in an attempt to bring Amir back to his right mind. Stirring from 
    what seemed to be nothing but a long nap to him, Amir attempted to 
    get up on his own two feet. As Vorin assisted him up with great 
    urgency, a gunshot suddenly echoed into the laboratory and the party 
    knew that their 30 minutes provided by Zeke were up. They got onto 
    the elevator and left to meet the potential race from danger that 
    most likely was awaiting them back on the surface.

    Will our party be able to escape the possible detection of the El Sol 
    guardsmen and U.R.S.? Is Theo dead for good this time? Who is the 
    “master” Theo mentioned and what did he mean by the goals to 
    “reshape the world in their image?”What is the exact nature of 
    the so-called “Pneuma Gates” mentioned by Theo? Where in the world 
    is Naverene, Diz, and the remaining members of the Bethelaham five 
    known as Rynok and Agoni?`

    chapterSummary: `After hearing Zeke's signal shot ring throughout the 
    lab, our party quickly boarded the elevator up and out back to the 
    surface. They quickly found themselves surrounded by surveyor bots 
    that were scouring the restricted district for them.
    
    Using his deluminator, Amir and the rest of the party began to sneak 
    through, avoid the bots and make headway towards the district exit. 
    Unfortunately, El Sol guard bots were now roaming the streets in 
    search of the intruders when one scanned and detected the darkness 
    spell cast by the deluminator. Though confident in their offensive 
    strategy at first, the party quickly learned that these bots were 
    formidable and decided instead to race towards the district exit.

    A dastardly chase ensued with the party using everything they could 
    around them to obstruct and harm the bots as they relentlessly chased 
    them through the streets and alleyways of the Pluto district.
    They managed to escape, only to find that Zeke seemed to have his 
    hands full fighting off some guard bots himself.

    The party quickly converged and came to his aid, defeating the bots 
    together. With their presence still an issue, the party and Zeke 
    decided it best to return to the old Strakin safehouse where Zeke 
    had taken them before. Upon arriving, he stated that the party was 
    welcome to stay and recover there for the night but that they had to 
    go back into their disguises and leave in the morning.

    With the first day in El Sol complete, the party still has 29 days to
    go before The Invaders come to begin their assault on the city. 
    What will the party choose to do next? Will they track down where 
    to go to possibly crack the black thumb drive obtained in the La 
    Luna Flare Lab? Will they try to seek out the other temples 
    mentioned to them by the gynosphinx? Will they explore the city 
    and see what adventures or experiences may lie within? It's up to 
    them to choose but the days may go faster than they think!`

    chapterSummary: `Completing their rest from the mayhem of the previous 
    evening’s chase, our party members decided that it was best to take 
    time to explore the city in an attempt to gather allies and prepare 
    for The Invaders and their coming assault. Zeke provided them a map 
    of the city marked with various factions that the party could 
    encounter and attempt to gain favor. He also provided a little bit of 
    information for each faction:
    
    Radiant Spectrum- They value individuality and unity. The Bhed have 
    recently gained more influence economically and socially within El Sol 
    and this faction is trying to counter this. But being a 
    grassroots-like movement, they have limited resources at their 
    disposal compared to the Bhed and other possible affiliated factions. 
    The main contact for this faction is Merric Tosscobble, a female 
    dwarf who is pragmatic and only looking to assist and bolster the 
    Spectrum.

    Pocket Rockets- A faction mainly composed of Dwarfs and Gnomes, 
    this faction focuses mainly on defending the “smaller but mighty” 
    crowd who live within El Sol. With Dwarfs at the helm, they pride 
    themselves on their own and seem to refuse help from any other 
    faction.

    Worker’s Union- A human based faction that focuses on ensuring that 
    no extortion or exploitation of the city’s middle class occurs as 
    income inequality runs rampant throughout El Sol.

    Prestige Pith- A faction that embodies affluence and wealth. 
    Mostly composed of moon-elves and humans, their name is derived from 
    the family name Pith, an influential and privileged name within the 
    Palelight Kingdom’s caste system. Their influence seems to be more 
    apparent as the Bhed and the Church of the Sun become more prominent 
    throughout El Sol.

    Church of the Sun- The main religious faction within the Corona 
    Kingdom and El Sol, their influence seems to have skyrocketed with 
    the mix of higher Bhed influence and the recent disasters that have 
    befallen within the Corona Kingdom. They live and work for one 
    supposed purpose, serving their sun god.

    Corona Kingdom- The official governing body of the kingdom itself. 
    Upon arriving within the city, martial law was revealed to be in place. 
    Diz Deependwell was planning on alerting the King of the coming attack 
    but instead had to go find out what happened to his stone as it was 
    not delivered as he had planned. Coda and Cora decided to go and try 
    to alert the King instead but you have not heard from then since they 
    left. Zeke reveals that there are bounties that could be pursued for 
    the kingdom.


    After receiving this information, the party decided that they would 
    first seek out the Radiant Spectrum faction and attempt to gain their 
    favor. Referencing their map, they traveled to the Jupiter district 
    and found themselves at the Red Storm pub where a friendly bartender, 
    who just so happened to be a member of the Spectrum herself, 
    provided the information necessary for the party to seek out Merric 
    Tosscobble in the Saturnus district.

    The party found themselves approaching a very humble and plain 
    looking office space where a quaint little female dwarf awaited them. 
    She introduced herself as Merric Tosscobble and explained that the 
    Radiant Spectrum could use their help as persuasive business folk to 
    try and convince the Pocket Rockets to accept the Spectrum’s aid and 
    form a pact. The party agreed to assist her and went on their way to 
    introduce themselves to a Travok Ironfist, the supposed leader of the 
    Pocket Rockets.


    Arriving in the Terra District, our party made it to the descending 
    stairs and iron door to the underground HQ of the Pocket Rockets. 
    Upon arriving, a small sliding slit in the door opened as only the 
    eyes of the doorkeeper could be seen as he spoke and asked what 
    business the party had with them. The party attempted to explain that 
    they were there on behalf of the Radiant Spectrum but the gatekeeper 
    rudely cut them off and said that they needed the help of “those who 
    could fight.” Not believing the party’s claims that they knew how to 
    handle combat, the gatekeeper came out in an attempt to “test” their 
    abilities. With a quick display of their abilities, the party quickly 
    convinced the gatekeeper dwarf that not only were they plenty 
    experienced with combat, but that they were going to show him mercy. 
    He quickly agreed to let them in and have their audience with 
    “Mr. Fist.”

    Travok Ironfist was a rugged looking dwarf with peppered hair and a 
    missing left eye. He not only revealed that Merric was his cousin and 
    that she was “annoying” but that the Pocket Rockets required help in 
    freeing some of their members who were recently thought to have been 
    “enslaved” against their will and against the law of the city. 
    His task for the party, freeing the 20 members of the Pocket Rockets 
    located within two different places within the city, one location 
    within the Uranus district and the other, located within the Venus 
    district. The members are to be returned unharmed and if the task is 
    completed as such, Mr.Fist agreed to gladly making a pact with the 
    Radiant Spectrum.`
