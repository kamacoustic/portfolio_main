    cBio:`The Black Hand of Amir- Known more simply as "The Hand," this Kenku, (ravenhead), 
    mercenary has lived to serve Amir for some time, despite being separated from him.
    Joining the infamous Strakin thieves guild, The Hand has traveled far and wide to assist his master in finding a way to become 
    a lich. Once Amir fell in battle, this mysterious mercenary suddenly appeared in an attempt to reunite with his master once more.
    Although a lot of questions shroud this character, one thing is absolutely clear, The Hand is a honed killing machine. 
    Using a mix of a classic nodachi blade, a rocket propelled hammer, and a jetpack that allows for more maneuverability,  
    The Hand truly fears no foe. Since Amir has met his end, The Hand has renowned focus on achieving one goal, 
    reuniting with his beloved Amir, no matter what that takes.`

    cBio:` A mysterious yet brash half-elf, half-orc. Because of the reputation one gets for having any type of relation to orcs, 
    Amir chooses to hide his orcish facial features, (orcish jowles and prominent canines), behind a veil. 
    Mostly raised at an orphanage, his true lineage remains a mystery. A zealot of his own beliefs that there is not a sun or a moon
    but simply one God, Amir's thirst for power and control motivates him to spread his own holy reality. 
    Obsessed with the nature of life and death his true intention of traveling with these "followers" of his is to find a way to 
    become a lich, the ultimate showcase of life and death. Amir's innate "sorcerer" like powers enable him to manipulate 
    life energy with ease. A rare trait within the new world, but that fact is unbeknownst to Amir himself.`

    atoms when an unintended effect occurred and suddenly, he found himself in this new world. A thirst for expanding his knowledge

    cBio:`A charismatic, half-elf paladin from another world. His handsome features aside, 
    , Rondel is a fierce and capable warrior who serves as an avatar of justice for his goddess, Shiva. 
    Since finding himself within this new world, Rondel has seen and experienced things he had never thought possible, 
    and feels a little out of his natural elements. Still, he never allows his party members to doubt his capabilities, 
    especially his travel companion, Tontai. Whilst within this new world, Rondel has had trouble communicating with Shiva and 
    has even abandoned his means of prayer to her, his prayer bead. Choosing to come and aide this world, Rondel is sure to make 
    his mark and become a legend before returning to his home world. `

    this dark-elf monk is the definition of silent yet deadly. Many foes have already mistaken Tontai’s radiant yet subtle solace 
    and have paid the price. Although small in stature compared to some of her most recent company, Tontai’s almost 
    supernatural reflexes give her an ever-present advantage in whatever scenario she might find herself in. 
    It’s almost as if her pale yet incandescent eyes are capable of perceiving a different field of vision not possible by
    the average being. Volunteering to aid this mysterious world alongside her beloved companion, Rondel, Tontai has proven that 
    her teachings and character are ubiquitous.`

    conquest. Before he was summoned, Vorin had recently taken charge of his goliath tribes through sheer violent strength and power
    of will. Now stripped away from that, Vorin has been adventuring along with these mysterious characters bent on following 
    their quest through to the end. Although slowly, he’s beginning to understand and trust other things rather than just his
